                                <h4>Log Data</h4>
                                <p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in
                                    the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your
                                    phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device
                                    Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
                                    configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your
                                    use of the Service, and other statistics. </p>

                                <h4>Cookies</h4>
                                <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous
                                    unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you
                                    visit and are stored on your device&#8217;s internal memory. </p>

                                <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use
                                    third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and
                                    improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these
                                    cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to
                                    refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Service Providers</h4>
                                <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                                    <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                                    <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                                    <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to
                                    your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them
                                    on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the
                                    information for any other purpose. </p>

                                <h4>Security</h4>
                                <p style="text-align:left">I value your trust in providing us your Personal
                                    Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of
                                    protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or
                                    method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee
                                    its absolute security.</p>

                                <h4>Dealing with Non-Genuine Purchases </h4>
                                <p>The Activation Server is configured to check the genuineness of purchase after a
                                    period of time. If any purchase that <strong>NOT</strong> tends to be
                                    <em><strong>genuine</strong></em>, will be deactivated immediately and if user
                                    &#8216;You&#8217; are failed to proof the purchase then the purchase will be
                                    removed and tracked, also continuous attempts might prevent the device from
                                    using any of services in future.</p>

                                <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
                                <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party
                                    link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not
                                    operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of
                                    these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the
                                    content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Children’s Privacy</h4>
                                <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly
                                    collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                                    I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I
                                    immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and
                                    you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please
                                    contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions. </p>

                                <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to

                                    by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective
                                    immediately after they are posted on this page. </p>
